Here I am working on Face recognition based Attendance Management System by using OpenCV(Python). One can mark thier attendance by simply facing the camera.
Makes attendance records in realtime using python's face recognition library. All we need is one image of the person to be detected by the camera.

Technology used : 
-openCV (Opensource Computer Vision)
-Python 
-tkinter GUI interface

How it works :
When we run Start.py a window is opened and ask for Enter Id and Enter Name and Enter Intake Code. After enter name and id and code then we have to click Take Images button. 
By clicking "Take Images" camera of running computer is opened and it start taking image sample of person.
This Id and Name and Code is stored in folder "Student_Details" and file name is "Student_Details.csv". 
It takes 60 images as sample and store them in folder "Train Images".
After completion it notify that iamges saved. 
After taking image sample we have to click "Train Image" button.
Now it take few seconds to train machine for the images that are taken by clicking "Take Images" button and creates a "Train_Result.yml" file and store in "Train_Result" folder. Now all initial setups are done. By clicking "Track Image" button camera of running machine is opened again. 
If face is recognised by system then Id and Name of person is shown on Image. Press Q(or q) for quit this window.After quitting it attendance of person will be stored in Attendance folder as csv file with name, id, code, date and time and it is also available in window.

Admin Panel:
Admin can manage the student's detail with the "Admin_Panel.py" code.
After seleting a row, if you click "Delete Row" button, row is deleted.
And you can edit the values by double clicking about the values.
You can save the details by clicking "Save Table" button.
